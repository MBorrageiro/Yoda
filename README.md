YODA PRNG project Verilog code and final report YODA (Your Own Digital Accelerator) 
This project is run each year in the high performance embedded systems final year course. 
It sees students put into groups to develop a digital accelerator on the parallel Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).

Our group's goal was to develop a parallel random number generator on the FPGA and compare it to a golden measure C++ version. 
Both measures implemeneted the same algorithm to produce the random numbers and thus made for a fair comparision.

Further details on the algorithm and investigations of the project can be found in the project report file.
