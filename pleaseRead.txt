Just to explain the difference in files:

BRAM2 (Project files):
- This is a stress tested version of the project.
- It ONLY writes to BRAM and there is no read or reset implementation.
- However, this was the project used to conduct the test in the result section.
- It is therefore well tested and the main features are present.


PRNG Wr Re and Reset Project (Project files):
- This version has all luxurious features such as write, read and reset.
- The code works, however there was not sufficient time to stress it
	and ensure it works for most cases.


PRNG Wr Re and Reset Modules Only 
- contains only the .v files for the luxurious version

PRNG Wr to BRAM Module Only
- contains only the .v files for the stress tested version
